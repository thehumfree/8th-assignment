          great man add a awesome CEO for APPLE.He has inspired me to one day
          and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to
          own apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than
          before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's great man and i

        <h3><b>Steve Jobs</b></h3>
        <p>
          What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story i've
          written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published),
          almost every email i've ever written, has been written on machines
          created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long
          before i ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to relelize the Star
          Trek future i dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision. I have been
          able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your
          amazing work

        <p>
          A part of my heart has cracked. I didnt know him personally but i felt
          like i knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened
          because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles.
          Heaven has certainly gained an angel.

          Dear Apple, I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve
          Jobs, the great leader and creator in the world I believe he would go
          to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple.
          We will remeber him forever.
